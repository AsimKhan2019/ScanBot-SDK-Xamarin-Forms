# Example App for Scanbot SDK Xamarin Forms

This example app shows how to integrate the Scanbot SDK in a **Xamarin.Forms** project (Android & iOS).

## What is Scanbot SDK
The Scanbot SDK brings scanning and document creation capabilities to your mobile apps. It contains modules which are individually licensable as license packages. For more details visit our website https://scanbot.io/sdk.html

The Scanbot SDK is available as a NuGet package for the Xamarin.Forms platform:
[ScanbotSDK.Xamarin.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScanbotSDK.Xamarin.Forms)


## Requirements
[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) with [Xamarin Platform](https://www.xamarin.com)
(For iOS Visual Studio for Mac **7.4+**)


## Documentation
The documentation of the current Scanbot SDK Xamarin release can be found here: [https://scanbotsdk.github.io/documentation/xamarin/](https://scanbotsdk.github.io/documentation/xamarin/)


## Please note
This example app doesn't contain a Scanbot SDK license key and runs in a **trial mode (trial period of 1 minute)**!
After the trial period is over the Scanbot SDK functions will stop working. The UI components (like Scanning UI) will stop working or may be terminated. You have to restart the app to get another trial period.
